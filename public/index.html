    <h2>Why I Chose These Things:</h2>
    <p>I have always had a love for playing games. They have always helped me kind of escape reality for a couple hours and just relax. I love tasting all type of different and new foods. I love my family and friends. I also love money, money makes me happy. Most of all I love my bed. Most comfortable place on the planet for sure.</p>
